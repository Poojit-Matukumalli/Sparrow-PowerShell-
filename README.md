Sparrow PowerShell  
#Sparrow is my alias. Don't mind this

A lightweight custom Python terminal inspired by Microsoft PowerShell.
My first GitHub project, supports basic shell like commands

Features -------------------------------------

- 'help' -> Shows a list of commands  
- 'echo <text>' → Print text  
- 'cls' → Clear the screen  
- 'del <file>' → Delete a file (with safety check for System32)  
- 'New-Item <name>' → Create a new file  
- 'time' → Show current time  
- 'ls' → List files in the current directory  
- 'pwd' → Show current working directory  
- 'cd <path>' → Change directory  
- 'gc <file>' → View file contents
- And much more
